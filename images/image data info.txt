The set includes images of 50 US state capitals and Washington DC.

The image dates can range from 2016 to 2020 since environmental factors
lend to inconsistent images (primarily cloud coverage).

Each city has two images and any quantified topographical changes will be 
described as a rate: 

% change in heatmap / (year_2 - year_1) 

with the implicit assumption that this change will be close to linear.
