    "\n",
    "Sattelite image anaylsis can have a plethora of pracitcal applicatons. Because sattelites can take pictures all over the surface of the planet they can capture formations and patterns in ways we can't see on the ground. In 2019 a group of researchers trained an ai to find geoglyphs, discovering new sets of Nazca lines (Becky Little,https://www.history.com/news/nazca-lines-peru-ai). This just shows one example of the potential of large scale sattelite image analysis. \n",
